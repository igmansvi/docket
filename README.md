# Docket

Docket is a cross-platform notesheet and document tracking application designed for organizations and institutions. It helps users create, submit, and track documents (notesheets) sent to various authorities for suggestions, approvals, or rejections. The app streamlines the workflow for document review and maintains a clear audit trail of all actions.

- Track the status of each document (draft, pending, approved, rejected).
- Add comments and view review history for each notesheet.
- View dashboard with document statistics and recent activities.
- Works on Web, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS.
